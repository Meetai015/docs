Thank you for your interest in contributing to Gistly Call Analytics! This guide will help you understand the contribution process and standards.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- Python 3.11+ installed (for backend development)
- Node.js 19+ installed (for frontend development)
- PostgreSQL 14+ installed and running
- Git installed and configured
- A GitHub account

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

<Steps>
<Step title="Fork and Clone">

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gistly-call-analytics.git
cd gistly-call-analytics
```

</Step>

<Step title="Backend Setup">

Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend-meeting-notes
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv backend-env
source backend-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: backend-env\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up the database:

```bash
createdb test_backend_database
```

Configure environment variables (create `.env`):

```bash
FLASK_APP=run.py
FLASK_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/gistly_db
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

Install pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

</Step>

<Step title="Frontend Setup">

Navigate to the frontend directory in a new terminal:

```bash
cd meeting-notes-dashboard
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `test/` - Test additions or updates

### 2. Make Your Changes

Follow the code style guidelines outlined in our [Code Style](/development/code-style) documentation.

### 3. Run Tests

Before committing, ensure all tests pass:

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend-meeting-notes
python -m pytest tests/
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd meeting-notes-dashboard
npm test
```

### 4. Run Linters

Our pre-commit hooks will automatically run linters, but you can run them manually:

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend-meeting-notes
black .           # Format code
ruff check .      # Lint code
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd meeting-notes-dashboard
npm run lint
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Use clear, descriptive commit messages following our conventions (see below).

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"
```

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub following our PR guidelines.

## Commit Message Conventions

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

- `feat` - A new feature
- `fix` - A bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation only changes
- `style` - Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf` - Performance improvement
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Changes to build process or auxiliary tools
- `ci` - CI/CD changes

### Examples

```bash
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support

Add support for Google and GitHub OAuth2 authentication.
Implements user profile creation on first login.

Closes #123
```

```bash
fix(api): resolve race condition in meeting updates

The race condition occurred when multiple users updated
the same meeting simultaneously. Fixed with database locks.

Fixes #456
```

```bash
refactor(database): optimize query performance

Reduce N+1 queries by using SQLAlchemy eager loading.
Improves response time by 40%.
```
